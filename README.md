# Predicting Restaurant Success: A Sentiment-Based Approach to Star Rating Forecasting

## Overview

This project aims to predict restaurant star ratings using sentiment analysis of online reviews.  We analyze a dataset of restaurant reviews, extracting sentiment scores to build a predictive model capable of forecasting future ratings. This model can provide valuable insights for restaurant owners to inform strategic decisions related to menu, service, and marketing. The analysis involves data cleaning, sentiment analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (or spaCy - specify which is used)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Main Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization plots (e.g., sentiment distribution, model performance curves) and save them as PNG files in the `output` directory.  These files will provide a visual representation of the data and model's performance.  The exact files generated may vary depending on the analysis performed.
